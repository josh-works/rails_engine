# README

This will be some running notes from Josh (and eventually Lauren) on the project.


We'll clean this up before evals.
- [Project description from backend.turing.io](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)
- Might need to refer to [this JSON lesson](http://backend.turing.io/module3/lessons/json_fundementals)
- This is an api-only app, per http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html
- [Some project notes/notes for Lauren from first day's classes](https://gist.github.com/josh-works/d1bfafccc392fee2cee5a2ecf61efc56)
- We need to import this data: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/sales_engine/tree/master/data
- [spec harness](https://github.com/turingschool/rales_engine_spec_harness)
